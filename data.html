<p style="line-height: 30px;">Experts Efficiently and accurately transferring your data.With our deep product and accounting knowledge we ensure a smooth transition when upgrading or switching software applications, giving you peace of mind that all existing data is intact and accounts are accurate.<br>
    
1.	Data Conversions<br>
When your company changes which version of QuickBooks you are using, it is necessary to change your current data into a format the new version can use. This process is necessary when upgrading from one year of QuickBooks to a newer one, upgrading from Pro or Premier to Enterprise, or changing to or from a desktop QuickBooks version to QuickBooks Online.
<br>
    How It Works<br><br>
While these conversions are designed to be a simple process, and normally go very smoothly, the best results come from making sure your file is ready for the conversion and checking the results afterwards to make sure the process worked as expected. Our team brings years of experience to the process to keep it simple for you.
<br><br>
We’ve performed thousands of QuickBooks data conversions from many different accounting systems. Whether you’re a an early-stage startup using Excel, or an established business looking to streamline your accounting, we can help you convert to Quickbooks – the #1 accounting software.
    <br>
We Take The Stress Out Of Switching Accounting Systems<br><br>
Converting your accounting system can be daunting. Depending on how long you’ve been in business there may be several GB of data, and your current accounting system is likely not a 1-to-1 match with QuickBooks. QBDataService is an experienced conversion provider you can trust. We have performed more than 1,000 QuickBooks data conversions and have developed a consistent process for conversion success.
    <br><br>
Working with QBdataservice you’ll have a dedicated conversion specialist who will assess your unique situation, determine which QuickBooks products you’ll need, and work with you to develop a phased conversion plan. We also employ full time programmers who will manage the export, cleaning, and import of your historical data. Post-conversion, your team will be fully trained on the new system, and we’ll help you put efficient processes in place that allow you to make the most of your new system.
Ensure all your most important business history is converted. Feel confident that all historical data will be properly migrated to the new system.
    <br><br>
Speed up the time to conversion. Reduce time spent working in two systems and eliminate double entry.
Ensure your system is set up correctly – all tables and databases are working and your bank accounts are properly linked.
Get more out of your QuickBooks. We can show you how to use the 150+ out-of-the-box reports, and custom create reports unique to your business.
    <br><br>
Build on top of your QuickBooks. We have experienced programmers who can leverage the QuickBooks API to build modules and add-ons.
Have an ongoing support team to troubleshoot issues and ensure your QuickBooks is growing with your business.
QuickBooks Conversion Process
    <br><br>
•	Phase 1. Determine Products Needed
    <br><br>
Your dedicated QuickBooks Conversion Expert will spend time getting to know your business, as well as your current system. We’ll learn exactly what your team needs out of an accounting system, and which QuickBooks products you’ll need. This may include QuickBooks Enterprise, Payroll, Point-of-Sale System, or Field Service Management.
    <br><br>
•	Phase 2. Template File Setup
    <br><br>
This process requires developing the proper workflows that will make QuickBooks fit your business like a glove, and ensure that we can perfectly absorb all of the data from your current accounting system. During this brief period, you may want to be doing double entry in your old system and in the new QuickBooks file. You pull data, including reports such as Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable, P&L, balance sheets by month, and any other data that needs to convert to QuickBooks.
    <br><br>
•	Phase 3: Go Live & Train Your Team
    <br><br>
Training your team is crucial to ensure that your company successfully transitions to the new software. We’ll do a training to make sure your team knows how to use your new system. Qbdataservice is known for its training; we have more than 200 training videos on our website because we want all QuickBooks users to be successful, even if they aren’t our clients.
    <br><br>
•	Phase 4: Close and Review The Books
    <br><br>
This process helps us determine if there are any other additional data or monthly reports you need to run your business. Many times we don’t realize which information is important until we no longer have access, so we’ll do a thorough double-check to make sure we’ve imported everything you need. If there are additional files which need to be moved, we’ll pull them over from your old system to QuickBooks.
    <br><br>
•	Phase 5: Follow Up & Maintenance
    <br>
We’ll let you run the QuickBooks software for a month or so and then check in and see how things are going. If you’re having problems, we’ll try to nip them in the bud. And if there are features or data that were left behind in your legacy system, we’ll retrieve them. We also encourage ongoing monthly / quarterly closing services to help you stay on track. Our goal is to make sure you are getting the most out of your accounting software.
<br><br>
With our deep product and accounting knowledge we ensure a smooth transition when upgrading or switching software applications, giving you peace of mind that all existing data is intact and accounts are accurate. Our team provides seamless data migrations to comprehensively move your data to QuickBooks so you don’t miss a beat.
    <br>
2.	Data Migrations
    <br><br>
When your company changes significantly, it means that your software must adapt accordingly. Whether you need to scale back, or expand, we’re here for you. Our team has mastered migrating financial data to and from QuickBooks, giving clients a pleasant transition rather than a painful one.
    <br>
Our QuickBooks expertise and accounting knowledge makes it possible for us to save you time and effort throughout your data migration. We make certain that your lists and accounts have been imported accurately, that your data integrity is intact, and that your chart of accounts is set up properly in your new QuickBooks file.
When A QuickBooks Data Migration Makes Sense
    <br>
If you have an existing QuickBooks company file, and need a new file with at least a portion of your existing data, a migration is necessary in order to move the essential data from your existing file to the new one.
Many different types of situations call for a data migration. The simplest scenario is when your file is quickly growing, and in turn – affecting performance and usability. In this situation, the migration typically involves only the most recent data in the existing file.
    <br><br>
Additional Example Scenarios
•	If your existing file is too large to convert to QuickBooks Online, it may be necessary to create a simpler desktop file from your existing file to do the conversion with.
    <br><br>
•	If your current QuickBooks file has data issues which are not simple to repair, migrating all or the more recent data to a new file may be necessary to provide a solid foundation to work with.<br><br>
•	If you are using QuickBooks Enterprise and find it is more than your company needs, a migration would also be needed to move existing data to a new Pro or Premier file, as data conversion processes are not available to move to the simpler versions from the more complex Enterprise version.<br><br>
•	If you are using a different financial software and want to move your existing data to QuickBooks. This typically involves exporting data from your current software to Microsoft Excel, which we format as QuickBooks expects and then import into QuickBooks.
Our team has extensive experience exporting data from an existing QuickBooks file, preparing it, and importing back into a new QuickBooks file.<br><br>
We’re here to help you identify whether or not you need a migration, and to discuss options for making a new file for you.
